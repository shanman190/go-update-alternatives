ACTIVE development and subject to changes.

***go-update-alternatives*** is a command line interface application inspired by the Linux update-alternatives native package. The premise behind update-alternatives is to provide an alternatives system for many Linux distributions. The goal behind this project was to provide that same alternatives system to a much wider audience, in other words Microsoft Windows, but it by no means should stop there.

Why go? Other languages could have absolutely been used. In this case, Golang provided a nice API in order to achieve the necessary functionality, all the while keeping the code simple and having the ability to compile for cross-platform use. While this utility may not need to penetrate into the world of Linux is does bring some of the great functionality created in that world to more people.
